    Ada Lovelace is my idol.  Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) was an English writer and mathematician.  She worked with Charles Babbage   on the Analytical Engine an early, mechanical  computer.  She also  wrote  the  first  algorithm  to run on such  a machine ( to  calculate Bernoulli numbers ),  make her the First computer programmmer in history.  
    Ada described  her approach as "poetical science",  and spent much time thinking about the impact of technology on society.

    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of ADA's life:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong> 1815 </strong>Born as Augusta Ada Byron on December 10 in London, England. Her father was the famous  poet Lord and mother was Anne Isabella Byron.
      </li>

      <li><strong> 1828</strong>Ada wrote her first book in 1828 when she was only 12 years old. She had always been fascinated by the dynamics of flight,  and in her book  called  Flyology, she examined this topic in detail.
      </li>

      <li><strong> 1829</strong>Ada was frequently sick and bedridden as a child. A severe bout of measles caused  her to suffer from a form of paralysis, and by the  time  she  was  in her early teens,  she  could often be seen walking  around on crutches.
      </li>      
      <li><strong>1832</strong>By 1832, Ada has recovered enough to be able to live a more active  life  which  involved  horse  riding  and music  lessons.  She   also   received   lessons   in shorthand from a young tutor, with whom she soon fell in love. Her mother did not approve of the relationship, and as a result, Ada ran away to the home of her tutor and his parents. She was, however,   immediately   returned    to   her    mother's care.      </li>
      
      <li><strong>1833 </strong>June of 1833, Ada was introduced to Charles
     Babbage, a man who would later be considered a hounding father of the computer. Babbage showed Ada his so-called Difference Engine, a machine that
attempted to perform simple calculations. Ada was intrigued by the contraption and immediately started thinking of all the possibilities such a machine might entail.
      </li>

      <li><strong>1835 </strong>July 8,  Ada married William King at age 19.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1836 </strong>Ada and William welcomed their first child, a son
	named Byron, into the world on May 12, 1836.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1837 </strong>On September 22, Byron was joined by a baby sister in the fall of 1837.
Anne would later become the co-founder, together with her husband Wilfrid Blunt, of the famous Crabbet Arabian Stud.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1838 </strong>When William King was made the Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada became the Countess of Lovelace, thereby giving her the name by which she would become famous.
      </li>
      <li><strong> 1839</strong>In July 2, 1839, Ada’s third and final child, a boy
named Ralph Gordon, was born.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1841 </strong>At age 25, Ada wanted to get back into the scientific world. In 1841, she was tasked with translating a lecture performed by Charles Babbage into English. The lecture was about Babbage’s new Analytical Engine, which was based on his previous work on the Difference Engine.        
      </li>      
      <li><strong>1843</strong>In 1843, Ada finished her work on the translation of Babbage’s lecture as well as her detailed notes on the topic, which ended up being much longer and more important than the translation itself. Her notes were categorized from A to G, the most famous of which was called Note C. Nowadays, the Analytical Engine is seen as an early model of  a computer while Ada’s notes describe, for the first time, a computer and its software. This work caused many to acnedit Ada Lovelace with the prestigious title of the world’s first computer programmer.        
      </li>
      <li><strong>1844</strong>ln the mid-1840s, Ada was often sick and bedridden, causing her doctor to prescribe her with a common medicine of the time called laudanum. Laudanum
consisted of a mix of alcohol and opium, and Ada soon became addicted to this potent drug. During these troublesome years, she also took up a horse gambling habit.
      </li>     
      
      <li><strong>1848</strong>Ada’s son Byron decided at the tender age 12 to leave the safety of home and set out on a journey of a lifetime. He eventually sailed all the way to Tasmania, Chile, and California.
      </li>      
         
      <li><strong>1850</strong>With the help of Charles Babbage,  Ada came up with a system that was meant to predict gambling odds on horse races. This failed miserably, causing Ada to end up with huge debts. During the last few years of her life, Ada is said to have pawned the family jewels twice to pay for her debts.
 </li>
      
      <li><strong>1851</strong>At age 35, Ada was diagnosed with uterine cancer. By this time, she was bedridden and extremely ill.
      </li>      
      
      
      <li><strong> 1852</strong>died at the age of 36 on 27 November 1852  in Marylebone, London, England.
      </li>
